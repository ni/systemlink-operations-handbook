The SystemLink Operations Handbook contains documentation, examples, and
example config files for IT professionals to use when managing an
[NI SystemLink Server](https://www.ni.com/systemlink) installation beyond the
basic configuration installed with SystemLink. For information about how to
install and use a SystemLink server, see the
[latest product manual on ni.com](https://www.ni.com/r/systemlinkmanual).
Source and contributions for the handbook and example files can be found in the
[systemlink-operations-handbook GitHub repository](https://github.com/ni/systemlink-operations-handbook).

While the handbook is not specific to any version of SystemLink Server, the
product continues to evolve over time. Some chapters or examples may
specify a version or range of versions of SystemLink that they apply to.
