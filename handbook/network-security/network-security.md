# Network Security

SystemLink connects test systems to a central server to aggregate data for monitoring and analysis. SystemLink uses standard tools and industry best practices to ensure the SystemLink server and test systems utilize secure networking techniques.

Refer to [Workspaces and Role-based Access Control](/rbac/rbac) for details users securely interact with SystemLink resources. Refer to [Single Sign-on with OpenID Connect](/openid-connect/openid-connect/) and [Sign on with LDAP](/ldap/ldap/) for details on security authenticating with SystemLink.

For brevity **HTTPS** is referenced for scenarios where HTTPS or HTTP could be used. NI recommends HTTPS for production.

## Network diagram

  <figcaption>The components and TLS protocols used by SystemLink.</figcaption>
</figure>

The above network diagram summarizes connections with the following components. Refer to [Setting up a SystemLink Server](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/2020r4/setup/setting-up-systemlink-server/) for information regarding ports used by SystemLink. TLS protocols are shown where available.

- **SystemLink App Server**:
    - This Windows server hosts NI Web Server, the various SystemLink services, and SystemLink web applications.
    - In the *single-box* setup, MongoDB and FIS storage are hosted on the app server.
    - Refer to [Sizing a SystemLink Server](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/2020r4/setup/sizing-a-systemlink-server/) for details on server system requirements.
    - NI assumes users with desktop access to the server are outside of the security controls and capabilities described by this document. Securing desktop access to the SystemLink app server should be managed by the customer's IT security protocols.

- **SystemLink Web app**
    - The SystemLink web application is the primary way users interact with SystemLink.
     `https` or `https` is used to communicate with the web application.
    - Refer to [**Web Server and TLS**](#web-server-and-tls) for details on configuring encrypted communication.

- **Testers**
    - Testers are systems who software and configuration are managed by SystemLink.
    - Software configuration occurs via the [SaltStack Transport Protocol](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/transports/).
        - Refer to [**TLS for SaltStack**](#tls-for-saltstack) for details regarding how SystemLink encrypts this communication.
    - File, tag, test, and asset data are published to the SystemLink app server over `https`.
        - Refer to [**Web Server and TLS**](#web-server-and-tls) for details on configuring encrypted communication.

- **MongoDB**
    - MongoDB is the primary database used by SystemLink's web services and the [MongoDB wire protocol](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/) is used to interact with the MongoDB instance.
    - Refer to [TLS for Remote MongoDB Instances](#tls-for-remote-mongodb-instances) for details on secure access and encrypted communication.

- **File Ingestion Service Storage**
    - The File Ingestion Services (FIS) can be configured to store files on either Network Attached Storage (NAS) or AWS S3.
    - NAS uses the `smb` protocol.
    - AWS S3 uses `https`.

- **Identity Provider**
    - Active Directory, LDAP, and OpenID Connect are the supported identity providers.
        - Local Windows account may also be used (not shown)
        - Active Directory used the Active Directory protocol.
        - LDAP uses the `ldap` or the `ldaps` protocols.
        - OpenID Connect uses `https` or `https`.
    - Refer to [Sign-on with LDAP](/ldap/ldap/). and [Single Sign-on with OpenID Connect](/openid-connect/openid-connect/) for details on using these identity providers.

- **NI VLM**
    - NI Volume License Manager (VLM) is used to enforce SystemLink node licenses.
    - NI VLM uses TCP and does not support TLS.
    - Refer to [Licensing SystemLink Products](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/2020r4/setup/licensing-systemlink/) for details on using VLM with SystemLink.

## NI Web Server

NI Web Server is based on [**Apache httpd***](https://httpd.apache.org) and includes the **NI Web Server Configuration** utility assisting users with choosing secure presets as well as a GUI for making changes to the various `.conf` files used by Apache httpd.

!!! note
    NI Web Server ships with SystemLink and various other NI software products such as LabVIEW.

    Refer to the [NI Web Server manual](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/ni-web-server/latest/manual/manual-overview/) for step by step instructions to configure your web server. The following provides details on the security features exposed by **NI Web Server Configuration**.

### HTTPS

NI Web Server supports TLS 1.2.

**NI Web Server Configuration** supports creating self-signed certificates, certificate signing requests (CSR), and installing certificates generated by a certificate authority. The DNS settings for the server can affect the operability of these certificates. Refer to [**DNS Configuration**](#dns-configuration) for details.

!!! note "Limited capabilities when using self-signed certs"

    When using a self-signed cert clients will not trust the cert by default. This can prevent certain operations from occurring.

    - Web browsers will not trust the certificate and the user must grant an exception to load the SystemLink web application.

    - Test results from the [NI SystemLink Test Monitor Client plugin](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/latest/tests/integrating-with-teststand/) will not be published and the error XXXX will be returned in the TestStand UI.

    - Packages built in LabVIEW cannot be [automatically published](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/latest/deployment/creating-packages-labview-package-builder/) to SystemLink server.

    - The LabVIEW Client API will have to explicitly disable verify server checks to communicate with the server.
        - Refer to [Open Configuration ](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/latest/systemlink-labview-node-ref/open-configuration-http-auto/) to details on this setting.

When you have received a certificate from an certificate signing authority, you can use **NI Web Server Configuration** to install the certificate.

1. Open **NI Web Sever Configuration** and navigate to the **HTTPS** tab.

2. Click the **Use a certificate from a signing authority** radio button.

3. Expand the **Install an already signed certificate** section.

4. Click the folder icon next to **Certificate file** and browse to your certificate file.

5. Click the folder icon next to **Key file** and select your key file.

6. If needed change the HTTPS port from the default, 443.

7. Click **Apply and restart**.

### DNS Configuration

SystemLink and NI Web Server do not ship with a DNS server. The following assumes a production DNS server is available in your environment. NI Web Server will attempt to provide a default for the DNS of your SystemLink server based on Windows OS settings. Other potentially valid DNS names are listed in the **Preferred host name for generated URLs and certificates** combo box. You may also manually enter another host name as needed. As the name of the combo box implies, this setting must match the host name that will be used for TLS certificates. This hostname is also sent to systems managed by SystemLink to inform them of the host name of the server. If an invalid hostname is provided data from managed systems will not be published.

### CORS and Remote Connections

In ideal scenarios CORS can be disabled to achieve a higher degree of security. In practice, CORS may need to be enabled to facilitate workflows for users developing web applications that interact with SystemLink's API. For this scenario, NI recommends setting up a *test* SystemLink server with looser CORS settings, such that your *production* SystemLink server can restrict CORS completely.

The settings for choosing a remote connection assist with setting Windows Firewall rules to ensure connections may only be established by clients on your preferred network.

Refer to [Choosing Remote Settings](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/ni-web-server/latest/manual/choosing-a-remote-setting/) for details on the various CORS and remote connection settings.

### Test System to SystemLink communication

Test Systems communicate with SystemLink over HTTP(S) and SaltStacks TCP protocol. Refer to [**HTTPS**](#https) for details on enabling HTTPS in NI Web Server.

Link to workflows for establishing a secure connection from target to server.

Per the target changing masters Josh says:
        The recommendation is that the customer sets a password on the target.  The person taking the system is required to enter the targets password.  In addition, we also show the current master when adding a system to confirm the user wants to take it.
        We show a warning in the UI for any RT system without a password.
        The password would also be required by anyone trying to use MAX to change the master.
 like 1
    Without the password anyone can ssh into the box with  `admin` and no password

Registration and credential transfer - Link to VI/API documentation on auto here

Double check if we are really automatically deploying Self signed certs to targets. I thought we just had only trust signed certs.


For windows you cannot set the password from systemlink. but Windows must have a password so we depend on this fact because someone login 
There is no way to steal a windows target because we can't ssh into and the registration process is driven by ssh into LinuxRT machines. 

Everything that is a job is salt stack TCP
All client recieve jobs, but the clients on their side filter out if they are supposed to do the job or not. If something is sensitive like passwords, api keys, certs. That doesn't use jobs  - it uses salt pillars and in this case it only goes to a single minion. Used in particular for passing API keys. 
Do not expose to the salt ports to the internet due to past vulnerabilities and  - use CIDR blocks in security groups to prevent access to salt except from specific networks (like your corporate network). 

the salt api service is a HTTP wrapper for salt mater - this is only exposed on master. Its a loopback port its bound to local host by default we recommend not changing this (port 811). This could be changed though a config file on the server for the services - again its not recommended to do this. 


### Communication with SystemLink web application

Enable [HTTPS](#https) for NI Web Server to enable TLS communication between the SystemLink web application and SystemLink server.

## TLS for SaltStack

TODO Discussion of how this cert is setup and configured

we dont' use TLS with Salt. The certs we are seeing are for rabbitmq and HTTPs

So its not TLS but they are encrypted AES encryptions - so this uses public private key security
They can recognize the authenticity of the client
If we replaced salt TCP with HTTP we would use HTTPS TLS
public private keys - client will generate its own pub/priv key pair
master will recieve the public key from the client - if the master accepts the minion its saves the key so it knows the minion and can decrypt the communication. If this key were to show up on another minion the master wouldn't accept it. 
Client will also save the master public key when it becomes managed, so it knows if the minion is trying to connect to a different master
Salt manages all the generation of the keys. 


https://docs.saltproject.io/en/getstarted/system/communication.html





SaltStack TCP Transport always uses TLS. This is configured and enabled automatically when you install SystemLink server.

## TLS for remote MongoDB Instances

MongoDB support TLS connections. Refer to the [MongoDB manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-ssl/) for details on enabling TLS. TLS can be enabled for remote MongoDB connections as well as the locally hosted instance of MongoDB that is default for new SystemLink installations.

Once TLS has been enabled for MongoDB you must configure SystemLink to use TLS for the remote MongoDB connection. 

!!! note
    `mongod` may be configured to not require clients (in this case SystemLink) from providing a valid client certificate. This document assumes that the `mongod` instance requires a valid client certificate to promote security best practices.

TODO do we only need to install the TLS cert on Windows app server when mongod is configured to require Client Certificate Validation. 

## TLS for remote file storage

TODO mention that repository files are always stored locally.

### Using Network Attached Storage

### Using Amazon S3

You can configure SystemLink to use Amazon Web Services (AWS)
S3 for FIS file storage. Refer to the [SystemLink manual](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink/latest/data/uploading-files-to-amazon-s3/) for steps to enable S3 storage. Uploads to S3 always use HTTPS.

!!! note
    AWS S3 for FIS file storage is a preview feature. Please refer to upgrade notes and behavior changes prior to upgrading SystemLink as the configuration needed to enable this feature may change.

## Deprecation of AMQP

AMQP as a transport protocol for node (TODO use a common term for node that also shows up in SPD) to server communication is deprecated in favor for HTTP. This process will be rolled out over several releases to minimize disruption to clients. NI recommends disabling AMQP on the server and updating test applications to use the HTTP version of SystemLink APIs.

1. Open **NI SystemLink Server Configuration**.

2. Go to **Security**.

3. Uncheck **Enable AMQP client access (less secure).

TODO discussion of AMQP deprecation, why we did this, and workspaces.

Put in details about how to disable remote AMQP access
