# Workspace and Role Based Access Control

In SystemLink 2020R2 NI introduced a new role based access control (RBAC) system. This security technology provides strong isolation between different *workspaces* as well as fine grain privileges for systems, data, and analysis routines in SystemLink. Collectively this capability allows access to SystemLink to scale beyond a single team to an entire organization.

## Concepts and design

SystemLink RBAC leverages concepts common to all RBAC systems such as *roles* and *users*. It also introduces concepts such as *workspaces* and constraints such as *automatic data encapsulation* to better serve the needs of organizations performing device validation and production test.
