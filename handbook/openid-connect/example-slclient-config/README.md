# OpenID Connect Configuration Files for SystemLink

There are three files that you must create to connect your SystemLink server to an OpenID Connect provider: [provider-dns].conf, [provider-dns].client, and [provider-dns].provider. The [provider-dns] portion of each filename must be the URL-encoded fully qualified domain name. Refer to [OpenID Configuration Files in SystemLink Server](http://https://operations.systemlink.io/openid-connect/openid-connect/#openid-configuration-files-in-systemlink-server)

Examples of these files are provided in this repository. In these examples the OpenID Connect provider is `https://slsso-runtime.com`.
